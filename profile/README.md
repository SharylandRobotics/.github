# Sharyland High School FTC Robotics Club

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Sharyland High School FTC Robotics Club**! Based in the heart of South Texas, we are proud **Rattlers** competing in the **FIRST Tech Challenge** as part of the **FIRST in Texas South Division**.

Our club is home to six competitive teams:

- **12395 – Rattler Robotics**
- **12397 – High Voltage Rattlers**
- **13580 – Tech Serpents**
- **13581 – Fang Gang**
- **13588 – Rattlerbots**
- **13590 – Viperstrike**

## Who We Are

We're a student-driven club that empowers members to explore robotics through real-world engineering, programming, and teamwork. Hosted at **Sharyland High School**, we provide opportunities for students to:

- Design, build, and iterate FTC competition robots  
- Develop Java-based code for autonomous and tele-op control  
- Integrate sensors, vision systems, and advanced mechanisms  
- Compete with pride, strategy, and sportsmanship  
- Engage with our local community to promote STEM education

## Our Mission

To inspire future engineers, scientists, and innovators through hands-on STEM experiences that build confidence, collaboration, and technical excellence — all with that Rattler bite.

## Mentors

We are guided and supported by an incredible pair of mentors who help bring our ideas to life:

- **Programming Mentor**: [@chrismlemoine](https://github.com/chrismlemoine) *(Mr. Lemoine)*  
  Provides mentorship in Java programming, structured design, sensor integration, GitHub collaboration, and software documentation.

- **Hardware Mentor**: **Mr. Elliud Hernandez**  
  Offers expertise in robot design, mechanical systems, electronics, and hands-on building techniques that keep our bots sharp and competition-ready.

Our mentors ensure that every student has a chance to learn, grow, and lead — both on and off the field.

## Competition Records

We take pride in our growth and achievements across FTC seasons. Here’s where you’ll find season-by-season performance and award highlights for each of our teams:

- **[13590 – Viperstrike](https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/team/13590)**

## About This Repository

This GitHub organization serves as the centralized codebase for all Sharyland FTC teams each season. Instead of maintaining separate repositories, we collaborate within a single seasonal project structure. Each team has its own dedicated subfolder under a `TeamCode` directory to manage and develop their individual robot programs.

Inside each season's repo, you'll find:

- A shared base project (using the FTC SDK)  
- `TeamCode` folders named after each team (e.g., `team12395`, `team13580`, etc.)  
- Reusable libraries and utilities that all teams contribute to and benefit from  
- Season-specific autonomous and teleop programs  
- Prototyping and test scripts for new hardware or strategies

This approach encourages cross-team collaboration, efficient troubleshooting, and consistency across our six-team program — all while giving each team space to innovate and build their own solutions.

## Get Involved

Whether you’re a student, mentor, alum, or community member — there’s a place for you in our Rattler Robotics family. Reach out to one of our teams or mentors if you’re interested in joining or supporting.
